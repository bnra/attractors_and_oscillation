Emergence of Attractor Dynamics in Stochastically Synchronized Networks 
and Interplay between Attractor Dynamics and Oscillatory Dynamics

* Hopfield-like Conductance Scaling in E-I Networks with EIF neurons
* Stochastic Synchronization
* Gamma-breadth snapshots of network activity as network state

Ever since Hopfieldâ€™s seminal paper on auto-associative memory models in 1982, Hopfield Net-
works have garnered significant interest, not least because of their powerful functional properties
and their ability to explain high-level phenomena in cognition, such as pattern completion. More
recently more biologically plausible neuron and network models have been applied successfully
to implement comparable network state evolutions by making use of network dynamics arising
from complex spiking neuron models and E-I networks. However, these mechanisms rely on highly
synchronous oscillation generated by an E-I network which is linked to pathological conditions
and requires cell rates for the excitatory population that are far in excess of empirical findings. In
stochastic oscillation on the other hand high, frequency oscillations arise as an emergent property
while individual cells spike irregularly at low, biologically plausible rates. In this project the emer-
gence of attractor dynamics in a stochastically synchronized network and the interaction between
the attractor dynamics and oscillation are explored.
